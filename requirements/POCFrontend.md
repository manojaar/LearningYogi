Learning Yogi PoC: Timetable Display Design SuggestionCore Design Concept: Minimalist Education SaaSThe suggested design leans into modern EdTech SaaS aesthetics—clean, accessible, and information-dense without feeling overwhelming. This approach is highly favored on platforms like Behance for its professional yet friendly appeal.Goal: To transform raw, extracted timetable data into an easily digestible, color-coded, and highly actionable daily/weekly schedule.I. Overall Aesthetic & LayoutAspectSuggestion (Behance Trend)Rationale for PoCColor PaletteSoft, Pastel Primary Colors for branding (e.g., light blue, mint green) complemented by a high-contrast dark mode option. Use vibrant, distinct colors only for subject categorization.Friendly, educational feel. Reduces eye strain during long planning sessions.TypographyModern sans-serif font (e.g., Inter, Poppins, or Roboto). Clear weight hierarchy for time vs. subject name vs. notes.Maximum readability and professional tone. High contrast is vital for accessibility.LayoutCard-Based Grid (Weekly View) and Vertical Timeline (Daily View).Cards make individual time blocks easy to scan. Vertical timelines are excellent for showing flow.SpacingGenerous white space (padding and margin) around all elements.Prevents the timetable from looking cramped or busy, despite containing a lot of data.II. Key UI Components for the Timetable Display1. The Weekly Grid View (The Default)The default view should resemble a familiar weekly calendar but optimized for fixed class schedules.Structure: A responsive grid with 6 columns (Monday to Friday + Notes/Breaks). The rows represent time slots.Time Blocks as Cards: Each class is a large, rounded card within the grid cell.Header: Class Name (e.g., "Mathematics" or "Registration") - Bold, H4 size.Subtitle/Tag: Teacher Name (e.g., "Miss Joynes") or Class/Year Group - Small, subtle text.Time: Displayed vertically on the left or top of the card (e.g., 11:00 AM - 11:55 AM).Color-Coding: The card's background or left border is color-coded by subject type (e.g., Blue for Math, Green for Science, Yellow for Arts).Actionability: A small Edit/View icon (...) on each card, enabling the teacher to quickly view the original text extracted or make manual adjustments (a critical PoC feature).2. The Daily Timeline ViewThis view focuses on a single day and highlights the flow of events.Structure: A continuous vertical line where each time block (card) attaches, similar to a chat history or notification feed.Visual Separator: Use a subtle, light gray vertical line. The class cards "hang" off this line.Time Markers: Large, distinct time stamps on the left side of the vertical line (e.g., 11:00 AM).Focus on Notes: The daily view should prominently display any extracted notes or reminders associated with that time block, as these are often vital for teachers.3. The Extraction Confidence Indicator (PoC Feature)To demonstrate the power of the AI, the UI should incorporate a subtle but effective way to display the extraction confidence (as mentioned in the project context).Location: A small, circular indicator or progress bar in the top-right corner of the timetable card.Interaction:High Confidence (Green): A small green checkmark or a 98% badge. No action needed.Low Confidence (Yellow/Amber): A yellow warning triangle icon with a value like 85%.Click Action: Clicking the indicator reveals a modal titled "Review Data Quality," allowing the teacher to see the original uploaded timetable snippet and manually correct the extracted text. This turns a backend metric into a user-facing feature.III. The PoC "WOW" Moment: OnboardingThe demo should start with a high-impact onboarding flow to showcase the system's core value (upload to structured data).Upload Screen: A large, visually appealing Drag & Drop Zone with a clear prompt: "Upload your Timetable (PDF, Image, or DOCX)."Processing State: Instead of a generic spinner, show a dynamic progress bar that cycles through the extraction steps (e.g., "Step 1: Document OCR..." $\rightarrow$ "Step 2: Identifying Time Blocks..." $\rightarrow$ "Step 3: Generating Structure..."). This visual feedback makes the AI process tangible.Completion: Transition directly from the processing screen to the fully rendered Weekly Grid View. The difference between the uploaded image and the beautiful, structured UI will be the moment that sells the concept.By implementing these clean, functional, and visually appealing design principles, the Learning Yogi PoC will look modern, trustworthy, and ready for an education audience, aligning perfectly with high-quality Behance design galleries.
